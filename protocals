🔌 Communication Protocols Used


1) ZigBee

*Goal: Low-power, short-range wireless communication.

*Role in the project: Sensor networks; capable of supporting a number of sensor nodes-soil moisture, pH, and temperature-communicating efficiently with a central controller.

*Rationale for selection:

*Low Energy consumption

*IoT-based agricultural sensor systems support this natively.

*Reliability over small-range data transmission


2. LoRa (Long Range)
  
  *Objective: Long-range, low-power wireless communication.
  
  *Role in the Project: It allows for remote monitoring of agricultural fields, especially in rural areas or large farms.
  
  *Rationale for selection:
  
  *Very extended communication range

  *Low power requirements

 *Performs admirably in regions with poor internet connectivity

 *Security Parameters


3. Data encryption

   *Objective: Protects sensor data during transmission from unauthorized access.
   
   *Application: Ensures secure communication among sensors, gateways, and servers.


4. Access Control

   *perms: restricts system access to permissions granted.
   
   *Application: Prevents unauthorized alteration of system data or configuration.


5. Physical Security
   
*Protection: Protects hardware components. Application: Arduino and sensors are enclosed in protective casings that would prevent                     tampering and damage.  

*Supporting (Implicit) Protocols Although not directly named, the following protocols are implicitly used: 

*Analog Signal Communication: Sensors to Arduino via analog pins A0, A1, A2 - Serial Communication (UART): Arduino to Serial Monitor for debugging and monitoring 

*I2C protocol: The LCD display uses this protocol for data presentation (LiquidCrystal_I2C)
