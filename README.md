# using internet of things application and its protocal  a Intelligent Sensing System for Crop Management

The Intelligent Sensing System for Crop Management represents an IoT-based solution for improving agricultural productivity by monitoring soil and environmental conditions in real time. The proposed system is interfaced with sensors that measure some of the key parameters governing crop growth, including soil moisture, soil pH, and ambient temperature. The sensed data are processed using an Arduino UNO microcontroller with pre-set criteria to suggest suitable crops based on the prevailing field conditions.

Employing IoT communication protocols, Zigbee, and LoRa, the system enables low-power and reliable transmission of data, thus making it suitable for application in rural and remote agricultural environments. Data gathered could be represented locally with an LCD display or remotely via a cloud platform. The automation project will reduce manual work and improve the usage of inputs and yields, thereby promoting smart, sustainable farming based on informed decisions.
